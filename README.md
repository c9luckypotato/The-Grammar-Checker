# The-Grammar-Checker
Implemented Binary Search Trees to store entries in a synonym thesaurus. If a word occurs above a certain threshold, the program will replace it with a random synonym from the thesaurus. This projectâ€™s goal is to practice good design principles as well as to reinforce my knowledge of Data Structure.
